**Today's Progress**: 
- Just repeated SQLs Cookbook's 6.12 Alphabetizing string for Postgres. It was getting difficult to follow the logic

**Thoughts:** Feel a bit overwhelmed all the projects at work. I really want to start working on my SQL project for dashboard 2.0, but im too tired. I'll start over the long weekend for sure.



<h1>Day 5: January 9, 2018</h1>

**Today's Progress**: 
- Worked on converting delimited lists into numeric rows for each value in the list. Learned a new function called split_part

**Thoughts:** Felt like it was difficult to dissect the query starting from the most inner ones. A bit disappointing that each dbms requires a slightly different appriach depending on functions available.



<h1>Day 4: January 8, 2018</h1>

**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed delimited list conversion from the SQL Cook book.
- Also tried to wrestle with weekly report in Alation. Need to figure out why ad_cost is higher then total spent in Campaign Manager.

**Thoughts:**  Feeling progress overall, but I really need to start building these weekly reports for my clients and generate more ideas at the same time on how to improve performance dashboards: For example, adding unique members reached per week (and % change), view-through impressions, and many more.


<h1>Day 3: January 7, 2018</h1>

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Continued to wrestle with  <a href='https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/15-days-of-learning-sql'>15 Days of Learning SQL" (hard)</a>
2. Completed SQL Cookbooks 6.8: Ordering by parts of a string

**Thoughts:** 
Found it challenging to create multi layer of derived tables in Hackerrank. 
I need more practice with Replace and Translate functions. Very cool when you do it one step at the time starting with deepest inner functions.

<h1>Day 2: January 6, 2018</h1>

**Today's Progress**: 
Wrestled with  <a href='https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/15-days-of-learning-sql'>15 Days of Learning SQL" (hard)</a>
**Thoughts:** Found it too challenging


<h1>Day 1: January 5, 2018</h1>

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Solved <a href='https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/interviews/problem'>Hackerrank's challenge "Interviews" (hard)</a>
2. Continue practising "SQL Cookbook" in Postgres. pages 109-112 (Working with strings)

**Thoughts:** Slightly struggled with joining nested queries

Here is MySQL solution to Hackerranks' "Interviews"

```sql
select c.contest_id, c.hacker_id, c.name, SUM(coalesce(total_submissions,0)), SUM(coalesce(total_accepted_submissions,0)), sum(coalesce(total_views,0)), sum(coalesce(total_unique_views,0)) 
from Contests c
join colleges col on c.contest_id = col.contest_id
join challenges ch on col.college_id = ch.college_id

left join (SELECT challenge_id, sum(total_submissions) as total_submissions, sum(total_accepted_submissions) as total_accepted_submissions from submission_stats group by 1) s on ch.challenge_id = s.challenge_id
left join (SELECT challenge_id, sum(total_views) as total_views, sum(total_unique_views) as total_unique_views from view_stats group by 1) v on ch.challenge_id = v.challenge_id

group by 1,2,3
having (sum(coalesce(total_views,0)) + sum(coalesce(total_unique_views,0)) + SUM(coalesce(total_submissions,0)) + SUM(coalesce(total_accepted_submissions,0))) <> 0
order by 1

```
